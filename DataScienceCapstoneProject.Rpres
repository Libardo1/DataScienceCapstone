Project Summary
========================================================

- Problem statement
    - Implement a [Shiny application](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
    that predicts the next word based on a phrase entered by a user
- Challenges
    - Frequency of word occurence in text follows a [power law](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/zipfs-law-modeling-the-distribution-of-terms-1.html) relationship
        - [~7K vocabulary](http://rpubs.com/mspcvsp/capstoneProjectEDA) is 
        required to model 90% of unique words contained in 1% of project text 
        data
    - [Limited memory](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/shiny-discuss/IFpkIuPTVRU/P3D4AuNRkUAJ) available for a deployed Shiny application
- Solution
    - Implement [Markov chain](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/assignments/markov.html) text prediction algorithm based on a vocabulary that models 68% of unique
    words in a 60% training data set

Predictor User Interface
========================================================

- [Text Predictor](https://github.com/datasciencespm/DataScienceCapstone/tree/master/shinyApplication) User Interface:
    - Step #1: Launch application by navigating to the [Shiny application URL](http://datasciencespm.shinyapps.io/EnglishLanguageTextPredictor)  
    - Step #2: Enter a text phrase into the text input box
    - Step #3: Press the "Predict Word Button"
